The human genome is a complete set of genetic instructions encoded in DNA. It contains roughly 3 billion base pairs, guiding everything from physical traits to susceptibility to diseases. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, mapped this vast code, unlocking new possibilities for genetic research, personalized medicine, and biotechnology.
