Renewable energy comes from natural sources replenished on human timescales, like sunlight, wind, and water. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, wind turbines harness the breeze, and hydropower uses flowing water. Advances in energy storage and grid technology aim to make renewables a reliable, sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
