Nutrition fuels the body, providing essential macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). A balanced diet supports energy production, cell repair, immune function, and overall health. Understanding nutritional science helps combat malnutrition, obesity, and chronic diseases, promoting longer, healthier lives.
