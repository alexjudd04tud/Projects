Atoms, the building blocks of matter, consist of a nucleus made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. The arrangement of these particles defines each element's chemical properties. Quantum mechanics governs atomic behavior, explaining phenomena like electron orbitals and atomic bonding, essential to understanding chemistry and materials science.
